    <p class="intro">During my education and career I have had the pleasure of
    working with working with many excellent people on several interesting
    projects, including those listed below.</p>

        <h2>Software Test Engineer at Fujifilm Medical Systems</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">Morrisville, NC &mdash; 2013 to present</p>

        <div class="technologies">
            <span class="label">C#</span>
            <span class="label">Selenium</span>
            <span class="label">JavaScript</span>

            <span class="label">Visual Studio</span>
            <span class="label">TFS</span>
        </div>

        <p>At Fujifilm, I design, code and maintain tests and test plans
        according to FDC regulations for medical systems. I have written
        integration tests, performance tests and exploratory tests.</p>

        <p>Primarily I work on an automation testing framework that is being
        built from the ground up to decrease reliance on manual testing. We
        use open-source software tools like Selenium to build a framework that
        will be used to run pre-deployment and regression test suites. Even in
        its early stages, the framework has led to faster tests and quicker
        feedback to developers.</p>

        <h2>Graduate Research in High Speed TCP Protocols</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">UNC Chapel Hill &mdash; 2012 to 2013</p>

        <div class="technologies">

            <span class="label">Scripting</span>
        </div>

        <p>Upon beginning my graduate studies I quickly discovered a passion
        for systems and networks topics. After taking several related courses
        I became interested in the effect of router buffer sizes on high-speed
        network protocols, and worked with <a
        href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~smithfd/">Prof. Don Smith</a> to design a
        study to examine this topic for my master's research project.</p>

        <p>I conducted an exhaustive <a href="/files/masters_paper.pdf">study</a>
        of the effect of reduced router buffer sizes on high-speed network
        protocols. With simulations and data analysis, I was able to show
        conclusive proof of the detrimental impact of reduced router buffer
        size on performance and make suggestions for improvements.</p>

        <h2>Graduate Teaching Assistant</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">UNC Chapel Hill &mdash; 2010 to 2012</p>

        <div class="technologies">
            <span class="label">Java</span>
            <span class="label">JavaScript</span>

            <span class="label">Computer Networks</span>
            <span class="label">Matlab</span>
        </div>

        <p>I deeply enjoy helping others learn, especially beginners. For
        five semesters, I served as a TA in introductory courses for
        Java, Javascript/HTML, Matlab and computer networks. During this time,
        I conducted lessons and tutoring sessions, held weekly office hours and
        one-on-one help sessions and graded assignments for more than 200
        students.</p>

        <p>In my first semester as a TA, I was honored with a
        <a href="http://chancellorsawards.unc.edu/?page=awardrecipients&id=64">
        Student Undergraduate Teaching Award</a>. Later on, I collaborated
        with instructors and other TAs for introductory courses to create more
        hands-on, relatable teaching methods for non-computer science
        students. Our efforts led to greater class participation, expansion of
        introductory courses and higher pass rates.</p>

        </div>

        <p>While an undergraduate student, I worked as a developer
        at a small web development company. Here I learned to design, deploy
        and maintain systems using the LAMP stack. The experience of working
        with organizations of various sizes - large and small businesses,
        non-profit organizations and government agencies among them - shaped my
        professional outlook and taught me how to quickly adapt to the goals
        and needs of business and regulatory environments.</p>

        <h2>Front Desk Manager at Regency Inn</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">Albany, GA &mdash; 2006 to 2010</p>

        <p>Throughout my undergraduate career, I worked the night shift at one
        of Albany's largest lodging and events spaces. As a front desk
        manager, I supervised auxiliary staff, trained and assessed new
        employees and performed financial auditing duties. I even put my
        computer science degree to good use through maintaining business
        hardware and software systems!</p>

        <p>This position ensured a solid foundation for my interpersonal
        skills and has provided me with no end of interesting stories about
        all of the people who came through!</p>
