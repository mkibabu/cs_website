    <p>While at UNC-CH and Albany State I had the pleasure of working
    on many interesting projects, including those listed below. I also
    served as a teaching assistant for several introductory courses, where
    I worked with a few hundred of our best up-and-coming computer
    scientists. I would be delighted to talk in more depth about any of
    these things!</p>

        <h2>Graduate Research in High Speed TCP Protocols</h2>

        <p>Upon beginning my graduate studies I quickly discovered a passion
        for systems and networks topics. After taking several related courses
        I became interested in the effect of router buffer sizes on high-speed
        network protocols, and worked with <a
        href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~smithfd/">Prof. Don Smith</a> to design a
        study to examine this topic for my master's research project.</p>

        <p>I conducted an exhaustive experimental and analytical <a
        href="portfolio/masters_paper.pdf">study</a> of the effect of reduced
        router buffer sizes on high-speed network protocols. Using TCL and C++,
        I ran simulations to validate the work of others. I was able to show
        conclusive proof of the detrimental impact of reduced router buffer
        size on performance, and make suggestions for improvements.</p>

        <h2>Graduate Teaching Assistant</h2>

        <p>I deeply enjoy helping others learn, especially beginners. For
        five semesters, I served as a TA in introductory courses for
        Java, Javascript/HTML, Matlab, and computer networks. During this time,
        I conducted lessons and tutoring sessions, held weekly office hours and
        one-on-one help sessions, and graded assignments for more than 200
        students.</p>

        <p>In my first semester as a TA, I was honored with a
        <a href="http://chancellorsawards.unc.edu/?page=awardrecipients&id=64">
        Student Undergraduate Teaching Award</a>. Later on, I collaborated
        with instructors and other TAs for introductory courses to create more
        hands-on, relatable teaching methods for non-computer science
        students. Our efforts led to greater class participation, expansion of
        introductory courses, and higher pass rates.</p>

        <h2>Web Developer at HyperMedia, LLC</h2>

        <p>From 2007 to 2010, I worked as a web developer for a small student
        tech company in Albany, GA. We used a variety of technologies to solve
        problems for local and regional customers. From my experience at
        HyperMedia, I am well-versed in PHP and MySQL, and have also dabbled
        with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Flash.</p>
