    <h1>Portfolio</h1>

    <p>While at UNC-CH and Albany State I have had the pleasure of working on many interesting projects, including those listed below. I also served as a teaching assistant for several introductory courses, where I had the honor of working with a few hundred of our best up-and-coming computer scientists. I would be delighted to talk in more depth about any of these things!</p>

    <p>Please excuse the dust as I gather materials for this page.</p>
