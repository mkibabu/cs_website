    <p>While at UNC-CH and Albany State I had the pleasure of working
    on many interesting projects, including those listed below. I also
    served as a teaching assistant for several introductory courses, where
    I worked with a few hundred of our best up-and-coming computer
    scientists. I would be delighted to talk in more depth about any of
    these things!</p>

        <h2>Graduate Teaching Assistant</h2>
        <p>For five semesters, I served as a TA in introductory courses for
        Java, Javascript/HTML, Matlab, and computer networks. During this time,
        I conducted lessons and tutoring sessions, held weekly office hours and
        one-on-one help sessions, and graded assignments for more than 200
        students.</p>
        <p>I also collaborated with instructors and other TAs for introductory
        courses to create more hands-on, relatable teaching methods for
        non-computer-science students. Our efforts led to greater class
        participation, expansion of introductory courses, and higher pass
        rates.</p>

        <h2>Web Developer at HyperMedia, LLC</h2>
        <p>From 2007 to 2010, I worked as a web developer for a small tech
        company in Albany, GA. We used a variety of technologies to solve
        problems for local and regional customers. From my experience with
        HyperMedia, I am well-versed in PHP and MySQL, and have also dabbled
        with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Flash.</p>
